Day 1: Research, Define, and Strategy Development
Morning
Research and Understand the Problem
Spend a couple of hours researching the coin change problem. Focus on understanding its significance and applications.
Review relevant literature or online resources to grasp the basics of dynamic programming in this context.
Afternoon
Define the Problem

Write a clear, concise definition of the coin change problem.
Prepare a draft for the problem section of your video.
Develop a Strategy

Decide on the tools and programming languages you'll use.
Sketch a high-level approach for solving the problem.
Evening
Outline the Algorithm
Draft a basic outline of the dynamic programming algorithm you'll use.
Write pseudocode or flowcharts to clarify your thought process.
Day 2: Algorithm Design and Implementation
Morning
Finalize the Algorithm
Refine your algorithm design. Ensure it's efficient and well-structured.
Complete the pseudocode, making it detailed and ready for implementation.
Afternoon
Code Implementation
Start coding your solution based on the pseudocode.
Focus on writing clean, well-commented code.
Evening
Testing and Refinement
Test your code with various inputs.
Debug and refine the code as needed.
Prepare the implementation section of your video, highlighting key parts of your code.
Day 3: Analysis, Video Production, and Documentation
Morning
Analyze the Solution
Conduct a thorough analysis of your algorithm (time and space complexity).
Prepare a brief but informative explanation for your video.
Afternoon
Video Production
Record the video, covering all aspects: problem, strategy, algorithm, implementation, analysis.
Keep it concise and ensure your explanation is clear.
Edit the video to fit within the five-minute limit.
Evening
Documentation and Final Touches

Create a comprehensive README for your GitHub repository.
Upload all code, resources, and references to GitHub.
Double-check the video and GitHub repository for completeness and clarity.
Upload and Review

Upload the video to YouTube.
Review all your work, make any last-minute adjustments.
